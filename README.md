## List of PMODs

- [Simon Says PMOD](https://github.com/urish/tt-simon-pmod) - For playing [TT04 Simon Says](https://github.com/urish/tt04-simon-game). Includes 4 LEDs, 4 Push buttons, a piezo buzzer, and two digit 7-segment display.
- [Tiny VGA](https://github.com/mole99/tiny-vga) - Tiny VGA provides VGA output for up to two bits per color with just one Pmod.
- [ChipTune Stereo PWM](https://github.com/WallieEverest/pmod_pwm) - Multi channel PWM audio filter for the TT04 ChipTune project. Includes analog filters, USB UART, LED status indicators, onboard speaker, and stereo connector.
- [QSPI Flash and PSRAM](https://github.com/mole99/qspi-pmod) - 16MB of Flash and 16MB of RAM over a QSPI bus to add some ROM and RAM to your project.
- [TT Audio Pmod](https://github.com/MichaelBell/tt-audio-pmod) - Mono PWM audio Pmod with line out and piezo speaker, designed for compatibility with the QSPI Pmod.
- [VGA Clock PMOD](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt-vga-clock-pmod) - VGA output (2 bit per color) + 3 input buttons, compatible with [TT03p5 VGA Clock](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt03p5-vga-clock)
- [KianV QSPI Flash and PSRAM](https://github.com/splinedrive/kianRiscV/tree/master/archive/pcb/pmod_nor_psram) - 8MB of Flash and 8MB of RAM over a QSPI bus to run uLinux on TT05, or as you prefer.
- [TT05 Stopwatch PMOD](https://github.com/I2SenseLab/TT05-SW-PMOD) - PMOD to immitate some of the functionality present on the Basys 3 FPGA board. It has 2 switches, 5 buttons, and a 4 digit seven segment display. It is directly compatible with [TT05 Stopwatch](https://github.com/devinatkin/tt05-stopwatch).
